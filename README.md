How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

For all of my code, I always start by creating a code outline and understand how I will establish the functional flows of the code. Then by the time I start writing code I am able to identify which areas need tests to ensure they fulfill specific requirements. Through Unit testing we can test each section of code that has a specific goal to acheive, once validated it makes it easier for understand any other logic issues the code may have. I also always give user input to someone in a survey manner to determine if there is some kind of input I didn't think to test for. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I find it best to interpret user needs through communication that is easy for a user ot understand, then giving them what objectives they expect the code to do and not do. Through this process identifying where the users wants and the codes capaciity to perofrm meet. 

How do I approach designing software?
Designing software is really alot like building a house, you must identify what is needed to build this software. Get the backend up and running, start with a basic structure in a Minimum Viable Product, then proceed to focusing on the objectivess of the code. Once some shape has formed out of the materials you've gathered thus far, we can test for what is needed to ensure it can acheive user expectations. Then through refinement I can create great code.
